<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is <b>Lt Col BT Okol</b>, a seasoned senior officer in the <b>Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF)</b> with a distinguished career in <u>military communication systems</u>, <i>cyber security</i>, and <b>information technology management</b>. I possess deep expertise in <b>network security administration</b>, <b>tactical radio network planning</b>, <b>fiber optics</b>, and advanced <b>telecommunication technologies</b>.</p>
<p>A graduate of the <b>Senior Command and Staff College, psc (U)</b>, I have complemented my military training with specialized courses in cyber defence, information security governance, and ICT systems integration, both locally and internationally. My strong technical background and leadership abilities have positioned me as a key driver in modernizing UPDF’s communication and information technology structures.</p>
<p>I have served in multiple high-level appointments including <b>Head of Communications and Information Security</b>, <b>Director of Communication and Information Technology (DCITS) – Land Forces</b>, and <b>Commanding Officer</b> of various CITS Regiments, where I played a central role in strengthening UPDF’s secure communication networks, safeguarding sensitive military data, and enhancing resilience against cyber threats.</p>
<p>Beyond operational responsibilities, I have been instrumental in policy formulation, ICT infrastructure development, and mentorship of young officers and ICT specialists, ensuring the continuity of skills and knowledge within the defence sector. My leadership has contributed significantly to the digital transformation of UPDF’s C4ISR systems, enhancing operational efficiency and national security readiness.</p>
